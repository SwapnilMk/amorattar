    question: 'What are attars and how do they differ from perfumes?',
    answer:
      'Attars are traditional, oil-based fragrances made from natural ingredients like flowers, woods, and spices, offering a concentrated and long-lasting scent. Perfumes are typically alcohol-based, lighter, and designed for broader application. At AMORATTAR, our attars are crafted for depth, while our perfumes provide a versatile, everyday option.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How should I apply attars and perfumes?',
    answer:
      'For attars, dab a small amount on pulse points like wrists, neck, or behind the ears for a lasting effect. For perfumes, spray lightly on pulse points or mist over your body from a distance. Avoid rubbing the fragrance into your skin, as it can alter the scent.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do AMORATTAR fragrances last?',
    answer:
      'Our attars can last 8-12 hours or more due to their high concentration of natural oils. Perfumes typically last 4-6 hours, depending on the scent profile and your skin type. Store them in a cool, dry place away from sunlight to maintain their potency.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are your fragrances unisex?',
    answer:
      'Yes, most of our attars and perfumes are designed to be unisex, appealing to all scent lovers. We craft each fragrance to transcend gender, focusing on personal expression and universal appeal.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the shipping options and costs?',
    answer:
      'We offer standard shipping (5-7 business days) and expedited shipping (2-3 business days). Costs vary by locationâ€”starting at $5 for standard and $15 for expedited within India, with international rates calculated at checkout. Free shipping applies on orders over $50.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is your return policy for fragrances?',
    answer:
      'We accept returns within 30 days of delivery if the product is unused and in its original packaging. Contact our support team to initiate a return. Refunds or exchanges are processed within 7-10 business days after we receive the item.'
